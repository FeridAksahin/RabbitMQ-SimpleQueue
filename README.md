# RabbitMQ-SimpleQueue


This project contains a sample implementation to demonstrate the basic functionality of the RabbitMQ message queue system. It consists of a publisher, which broadcasts product notifications, and a consumer, which receives these notifications. Communication between these two components is facilitated using the RabbitMQ message queue.
